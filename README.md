# websiteProject
Personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Primarily made to learn CSS and JS

Will be used as a personal website when the site is finished,
and hosted on a homelab when I get that started
domain name will probably be jackarnold.au, jackarnold.com.au or jackarnold.dev
.dev is expensive D:
